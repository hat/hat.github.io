  <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>
<br>
I am known to the world as Tony Hendrick. I'm a teacher, programmer,
and adventurist. In my current position I teach 6th graders all about how to
use a computer. I am currently on path to become a programmer full time.
<br>
<br>
This blog is the lens into my journey to becoming a developer as well as a
variety of other unique places to stop and explore along the way. I blog about
technology, gadgets, code, my undying love of knowledge, and anything else that
I feel will help me to reflect back on or engaging paths to anywhere my wandering
mind may go.

<h2>Life History</h2>
I first opened my eyes in Las Vegas, Nevada and have called it home ever since.
I have brought my talents to Zuffa LLC, or as most people know it UFC, where I
came straight out of college entering metadata for what was supposed to be a six
month over two years. In that time I pioneered the ingesting of their video
content to the Reach Engine and assisted in offline closed captioning. After my
time working with UFC I went back to finish college earning an AAS in Computer
Science at CSN and started working as a substitute teacher. I have had my own
class since the beginning of the year attempting to reach the minds of young 6th
graders into the world of computing. Starting in June of this year I will begin
working with ID Tech teaching the youth programming. I strive to learn something
each and every day and like Nicolaus Cage live a healthy lifestyle to traverse
<del>Earth</del> <ins>Mars</ins> for a long time.
