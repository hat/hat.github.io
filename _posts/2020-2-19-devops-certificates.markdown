#### Certificates - Are they worth it?

I have heard countless times from industry professionals that certificates are worthless, as well as have experienced teams where obtaining a certificate is a part of scrum board and quarterly goals. I find that certificates are indeed worth it but that they in no way will guarantee you a job nor are they a good indication of someone's expertise with the subject matter. <!--more--> As for myself, I obtained my first certificate March of 2019, the AWS Solutions Architect Associate. Having only some AWS experience prior, mainly Route 53, studying for this certificate allowed me join a team that relied heavily on AWS and understand what all the services were, why they were using them, and being able to see areas of improvement. Depending on how you study for the certificate will heavily impact how ready you are to use the technology at a client. Study just to obtain the cert and you will most likely forgot almost everything within a few weeks, study to understand the technology and obtain the certificate, you will be able to have a fundamental understanding of the technology at hand and how to use it. As far as getting a job goes, I feel that having a certificate to be able to put on your resume definitely will help get your foot in the door to the first step of the interview, but if you do not have any hands on experience with the technology outside of studying and obtaining the certificate, good luck on getting past the initial interview and potentially landing the job. Experience far outweighs having a certificate regardless of the topic. This may only be the case for DevOps certificates as I know in Networking certificates are near required for certain jobs.

As I have been recently studying for the AWS DevOps Professional Certification, my recommendation is also to not obtain a certificate that is above your current skill level. I could have kept studying to obtain this cert, but i was studying for the cert not to gain knowledge applicable to my career path as I had not used any of the services this certificate covers putting me at a disadvantage. Putting my time towards building my profile and gaining some hands on experience with these technologies is far more advantageous.

Quick side story, when working at a previous job an email went out to welcome a new employee who held over 100 certificates at one time and still had many that were valid and not expired. I met this employee while attending a Nutanix training to obtain a certificate and asked him the best way to obtain a certificate, as at that time I did not have any, and he explained the term Brain Dump to me which I had not heard before. I do not recommend using that to study as I know he was with the company for less than two months which may have been unrelated but goes to show certificates do not mean you will be successful everywhere.

#### How I Study for Certificates

I will break this section into two parts; how to study in order to understand the topic of the certificate that would be more applicable for what you will need to know for a job, and how to study for the exam itself.

The best way I have found to study in order to understand the topic as to how it will pertain to a job is to use the many resources and courses that are out there. The sites I use the majority of the time are [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/) and [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/), which are actually both owned by the same parent company now. Linux Academy is nice as the labs are completed in their environment and you do not have to worry about not cleaning up correctly and finding yourself with charges later on. A Cloud Guru, minus the "Hello, Cloud Guru's" intro of each video, is a bit better at keeping my focus at least with more examples and a bit faster paced. Recently I have found [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/) which I found to be by far the best for Kubernetes. There are also many other resources which would be just as great whether it be YouTube videos, Whizlabs, Quiklabs, and all the others out there. As long as you start by watching these lessons, I prefer 2x speed, you will be able to have a good foundation understanding. Make sure during the course you are opening the useful links which take you to the documentation. After the course or each section I would recommend going through the documentation as well as that is the best resource out there just is not as easy to read through without the lessons right away.

Now, the way to pass the exam are by taking many practice exams. The practice exams vary by site and topic, sometimes being more like the real exam on Linux Academy, Udemy, A Cloud Guru, or Whizlabs. Search around and read how other's studied for the exams and what practice courses they used themselves. I will list a few below as well for the certificates I have obtained. The practice exams that explain why the answer is correct as well as why the other choices are wrong are the most beneficial and what you should seek to find. The questions will not be exactly the same on the real exam, or at least not normally, but if you understand the why behind each question then you should be well prepared for the exam.
