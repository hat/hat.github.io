#### Certificates - Are they worth it?

I have heard countless times from industry professionals that certificates are worthless. On the other hand, I have also experienced teams where obtaining a certificate is a part of scrum board and quarterly goals. I find that certificates are indeed worth it but that they in no way will guarantee you a job nor are they a good indication of someone's expertise with the subject matter. <!--more--> 

I obtained my first certificate March of 2019, the AWS Solutions Architect Associate. Soon after I found myself at a client that used AWS and was able to understand the architecture and services they used. Studying just to obtain the cert you may pass but will forget everything quickly, studying to understand the technology and obtain the certificate is more rewarding. 

As far as getting a job goes, having a certificate on your resume may help get your foot in the door to the first step of the interview, but without hands on experience as well, good luck on getting past the initial interview and potentially landing the job. If you don't have any experience stick to the associate level certs. Experience far outweighs having a certificate regardless of the topic.

#### How I Study for Certificates

I will break this section into two parts; how to study in order to understand the topic of the certificate, and how to study for the exam itself.

The best way I have found to study in order to understand the topic as to how it will pertain to a job is to use the many resources and courses that are out there. The sites I use the majority of the time are [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/), [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) and [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/).

In order to understand the topic, find the course for the certificate on any of the above resources, or another platform, and watch all of the videos as well as complete all the labs. I prefer watching 2x speed and even having them play in the background, it is surprising how much you can retain. Make sure to open all the links and use the resources that are available. Also, read through the documentation for each section. The documentation is the best resource out there but is dull without the videos to complement.

Now, to pass the exam take as many practice exams as possible. The practice exams vary by site and topic as far as quality goes. Search around and read how other people studied for the exams and what practice courses they recommend. I have listed the resources I used below. The practice exams that explain why the answer is correct as well as why the other choices are incorrect are the most beneficial. The questions will not be exactly the same on the real exam but if you understand the 'why' then you will be well prepared for the exam.

#### Bonus Story

Quick side story, at a previous job a new employee who held over 100 certificates was hired. While attending a Nutanix training to obtain a certificate I asked him how he managed to obtain so many, as I did not have any at the time, and he explained about Brain Dumps which are ways to buy the actual exam questions to study from. While this option is out there, as it is against the terms of service for every certificate, please do not use this method. Also, he was let go after two months at the company... take of that what you will.
