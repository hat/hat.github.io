When it comes to Unity I am a complete beginner having only started working with
it for the past month and having no prior experience with game programming. I will
start by saying it is Awesome! I don't know how people used to make video games
before game engines like Unity and UnReal and hopefully that isn't something that
drives me insane as to where I research into building my own game engine when
these super powerful easy to use engines already exist and are free to use. So far
I have started working through the Unity tutorials and I've already learned so much.
I am planning on running through all of the tutorials before making my own game
so that I will have a great grasp as to how everything works, well and because
an idea for a game has yet to find it's way into my mind that is super ambitious.

Today I went to a Unity meet up where virtual reality was being discussed. Having
read about it online but yet to actually experience it, not being made of $, being
able to see what resources for developing on the different units was really eye
opening. Once I get around to upgrading my desktop the next to do item will be
saving up for either the Oculus or HTC Vive. Being around professional game openers
has swayed me slightly into focusing solely on being a game developer knowing that
the money and job security may not be the best in the field. What is more fun than
creating something so that others can have fun?
