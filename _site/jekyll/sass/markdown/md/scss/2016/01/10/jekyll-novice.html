What a learning experience it was to start with Jekyll having only dabbed
 into web development since the majority of my time is spent in the software
 world. It is quite frustrating to write a css file or html file to have it
 just up and disappear once you run the server. If only I had read <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home">the manual</a>
 before trying to just jump straight into the coding (Sigh). Anyway, after
 doing so and figuring out how the markdown language and sass works it was
 eye opening! The overall look of the site will definitely be improved over
 time but since I am going to go ahead and do all the coding myself without
 the help of templates that will take some time. Going to go back to Python
 and Unity for now so stay tuned.</p>
