<p>Having spent a good amount of time working on this site now, yeah I know it doesn’t
look like it, I have started to think that using ‘px’ to size an element might as well
be forgotten about. <!--more-->When I went through the classes to learn web development four
years ago or so I don’t remember there being any other way. This was, however before
everyone started using there phones and tablet to visit websites more than an actual
browser. A few years ago I tried to get back into building a site and attempted to
use ‘em’ but that ended up making my site look atrocious. I mean, you couldn’t tell
where one element began and another ended. Building this site I find myself constantly
looking over my css files to find that pesky px sizing to fix my site from being
readable on a phone or tabled only to an ant or a fly that is using the screen to
figure out where the nearest food particle that I dropped has landed. Yes, there
is still some uses of ‘px’ in this site and I understand it has a purpose, but it
is way less common now than before. I have also even managed to figure out how to
use ‘vh’ and ‘vw’! As of writing this there is probably an even better way.</p>
