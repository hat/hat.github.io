don’t know why that is since I don’t care what people think about me and never care
what I look like, but I don’t engage much with social media at all.</p>

<p>With that said, I have decided that I am going to start honing my photoshop skills
again and start posting different styles of photos that I have manipulated. To start
out at first the goal was to pixelize my face and make it look like a puzzle that
needed to be put together. Looking up tutorials on how to do this led me to once
again come across a tutorial on how to make a photo look like a drawing and this
one on <a href="http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2014/01/22/photo-to-cartoon-effect-how-to-use-photoshop-to-turn-images-into-drawings-or-paintings/">Digital Camera World by Jeff Meyer </a>
intrigued me with it’s multiple steps. It took me a few tries but I was pleasantly
surprised at how well I managed to have it turn out.</p>

<p>I really had planned on making it look like I was going to run for presidency with
this photo but while adding color one thing added to another and I realized I had
a red white and blue theme going on so felt the need to add the stars as well.</p>
