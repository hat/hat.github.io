    <p>There’s is nothing quite as satisfying as using your own hands to build something.
Whether it be using Legos and building a house, which I did all the time as a young
one, or using metal or wood to build a mech warrior. I decided to finally put the
<a href="http://www.makershed.com/products/make-javascript-robotics">Make book about
building javascript robots</a> to good use and attempted to put together the TypeBot.</p>

<p>What a blast! The best part while putting it together was cutting the wood for the
base since the rest was basically just hot gluing things together. My hands may be
extremely small for a man but there’s a reason I decided to not become a surgeon
and much like sewing, putting dabs of hot glue on things is not my specialty. I end
up just using my fingers to smear the glue on and then end up with bright red tipped
fingers that look like fire embers after pulling off the dried glue.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Bot_Pieces.jpg" /></p>

<p>The next part was to wire up the Arduino Uno to the three servo motors. This was
more frustrating than wanting cereal and opening up the fridge to find out you are
all out of milk. It shouldn’t have been that hard but the servos were purple, red,
and yellow instead of being red for power, black for ground, and yellow white for
communication. Thanks <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/155">AdaFruit</a>
for tasting the rainbow and thinking of crazy colors while wiring up your servo motors. Eventually I figured it out using my multimeter and had it all connected and up
and connected.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Bot_Finished.jpg" align="middle" /></p>

<p>I plugged it in, copied down the code, clicked run, and whala! I had it running
just fine and aligned the arms of the bot. Little did I know that the hot glue and
popsicle sticks although making for a cheap robot was not near strong enough to
click the keys of a keyboard. Not only that, it couldn’t even hold the bot up for
more than about 5 minutes before it came crashing down and needed to be re-glued.
After adding hot glue multiple times to each stick eventually I gave in, called
it a success, and I plan on now either reinforcing what’s already there or creating
a version 2. There’s a reason everything starts in alpha, goes to beta, and never
keeps getting updated with better version.</p>

<p>Until next robot, I will say this is the most fun I have had in a while!</p>

<p>Goodbye!</p>
