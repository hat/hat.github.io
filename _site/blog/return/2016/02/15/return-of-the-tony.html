in the midst of reviving my love of all things Jedi, Sith, and all the
Star Wars lore.</p>

<p>Looking back at this blog and how long it has been since I have made a post,
if my life were Star Wars movies I have finished my first trilogy and am
now onto my second. As for the title… something to do with
Computers, Sun, and Success.</p>

<p>Deciding to come to California originally to get back into taking
the steps to find out if I did in fact want to be a programmer
led to many great friendships, lots of knowledge, and a pivot from
programming to finding myself more down the DevOps career path.</p>

<p>I will keep this blog past rather short as I don’t see the need
to ramble about everything that has happened in the last four years.
Instead, I will allow this to be the first of hopefully many new
blog posts to come which will give more insight as to all of
the many changes that have happened since I built my first robot,
had some fun with Photoshop, and taught game development. Now that
I look back on these old posts, I have a desire to start doing some photo
editing and being a maker again. Stay tuned and may the force be with you!</p>
