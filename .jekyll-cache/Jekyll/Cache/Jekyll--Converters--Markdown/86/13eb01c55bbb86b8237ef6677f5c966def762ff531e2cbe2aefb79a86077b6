I"ò<p>Who needs pixel sizes anymore when dealing with CSS?</p>

<p>Having spent a good amount of time working on this site now, yeah I know it doesnâ€™t
look like it, I have started to think that using â€˜pxâ€™ to size an element might as well
be forgotten about. <!--more-->When I went through the classes to learn web development four
years ago or so I donâ€™t remember there being any other way. This was, however before
everyone started using there phones and tablet to visit websites more than an actual
browser. A few years ago I tried to get back into building a site and attempted to
use â€˜emâ€™ but that ended up making my site look atrocious. I mean, you couldnâ€™t tell
where one element began and another ended. Building this site I find myself constantly
looking over my css files to find that pesky px sizing to fix my site from being
readable on a phone or tabled only to an ant or a fly that is using the screen to
figure out where the nearest food particle that I dropped has landed. Yes, there
is still some uses of â€˜pxâ€™ in this site and I understand it has a purpose, but it
is way less common now than before. I have also even managed to figure out how to
use â€˜vhâ€™ and â€˜vwâ€™! As of writing this there is probably an even better way.</p>
