I"~<p>It all started when I wanted to move the RSS Feed from the footer to the header.
I figured since that sounded like an easy task to do it would take maybe 5-10
minutes tops. Boy was I wrong!<!--more--> I worked on it for a good hour trying to figure
out not just what a .svg file was but how to make one and then how to fix them.
I know all about .gif, .png, .jpg, .ai, but now you want to throw .svg into the
mixâ€¦ After some good all internet searching I managed to find that Illustrator
could convert an image into a svg file. I was mentally ecstatic thinking how easy
it would be so I open Illustrator, create a logo for the RSS feed, save the file,
and then create the html file and upload it to the site. I was just about to smile
and call it a success when I realized the logo was just a gray logo. Well, after
zooming in I realized my logo was there but just a black outline over a gray circle
making it invisible. After some time I realized the issue was that in Illustrator
I did not have a transparent background. Easy fix, or so I thought. If you zoom
in to the logo now, or at least until I figure out how to change it, you will
notice that there is some gray outline by each arc. After looking up how to fix
it and coming across no solution and knowing little about svg files I called it
a night and left the logo as is. I will come back to try to understand how you
work one day svg!</p>
